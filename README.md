# HoneyGO
A low-interaction SSH honeypot that mimics a real server, logs login attempts, and analyzes attacker behavior.

## Key Features:
* Simulates SSH login prompts and logs credentials.
* Captures attack patterns and common brute-force sources.
* Optionally forwards attackers to a real honeypot (e.g., Cowrie).
